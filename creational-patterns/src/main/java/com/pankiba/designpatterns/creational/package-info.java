 * <strong> Creational Patterns </strong>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Creational patterns abstract the object instantiation process. They hide how objects are created and help make the
 * overall system independent of how its objects are created and composed.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The creational patterns give you a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates it, how it gets created, and
 * when. They let you configure a system with "product" objects that vary widely in structure and functionality.
 * 
 * <p>
 * These design pattern/s provides way to create objects while hiding there creation logic, rather than instantiating
 * objects directly using new operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created
 * for a given case.
