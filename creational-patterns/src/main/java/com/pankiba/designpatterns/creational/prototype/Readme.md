#### Prototype Pattern

  - Details
      - Prototype design pattern is used when very similar objects frequently are required. Prototype pattern clones objects and set the changed feature. This way less resources are consumed.
      - It allows an object to create customised objects without knowing their class or any details of how to create them. Up to this point it sounds a lot like the Factory Method pattern, the difference being the fact that for the Factory the palette of prototypical objects never contains more than one object
